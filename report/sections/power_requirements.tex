\section{Power Requirements}\label{sec:power_requirements}
The Zybos need to be supplied with 5 V, which subsequently powers the sensors, the CAN busses and the WiFi.
The Sevcon has a 5V output, but it can only supply $\si{100 \milli \ampere}$, which is nowhere near enough.
Some tests along with datasheet lookups has been to determine the current needed for this system.\\

By measurement, it has been found, that one Zybo board draws a maximum of $\si{475 \milli \ampere}$ during startup. 

Idle mean: 396 mA
Idle max: (short spikes reaching) 480 mA
During login mean: 448 mA
During apt-get update peak: 680 mA
