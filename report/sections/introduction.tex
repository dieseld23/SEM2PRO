As a part of the Master's in Engineering in Electronics at University of Southern Denmark (SDU), an electric go-kart is made available to the students.
The go-kart serves as a development platform around which many of the projects throughout the programme are to be centered.
The theme of these projects spans several areas of science and engineering.
These could include power electronics components, computer vision, path finding or, as in the case of this report, networking on embedded systems.
While the types of projects differ wildly, mostly, they will have one thing in common.
A need for reliable collection of data.
\\~\\
Many tasks are simply too time consuming or difficult for a single project which means that it may be necessary to have different development teams working on closely related projects.
Having a unified strategy for data collection on the development platform will greatly ease collaboration between projects.
This project aims to create a backbone for data collection for the go-kart that will fulfil this need.
Modularity is a key aspect in making a system that can be useful in as many situations as possible.
\\~\\
The report was created using an analysis driven approach.
As such an emphasis was set on determining the requirements of the system.
Having a firm understanding of the requirements allowed the authors to perform informed decisions on the implementation of the system.
In order to better focus the work, daily meatings were held, discussing the progress and problems of yesterday as well as the focus of the coming day for each individual.
It was found that following this method lowered the amount of time a problem existed without the knowledge of the remaining members of the group.
