This section will describe the implementation of the sensors selected during the analysis.

\martin{We need to write something about implementation of the other sensors. We also need to use the same order throughout the report}

\subsection{Interfacing with the IMU}\label{sec:interface_IMU}



\subsection{Interfacing with the GPS}\label{sec:interface_GPS}
\mikkel{Is it enough about this?}
The used GPS is a u-blox NEO-6P GPS module.
The physical interface to the GPS is a usb cable and when connected to Linux it shows up in \texttt{/dev/}.
The output adheres to the NMEA standard and is made of 8 different NMEA sentences.
The RMC sentence contains all essential information, that being position, velocity and time.
Therefore the implemented GPS class, that has the responsibility of interfacing the GPS, only needs to decode RMC sentences.
An example of a RMC sentence is shown in code snippet \ref{code:rmc}.
The extracted information that the time is 09:11:23:00, the module is active, latitude is 55 degrees 22.03929 minutes North, longitude is 10 degrees 25.91037 minutes East, the speed is 0.348 knots over ground, the date is 7. of November 2016 and checksum is 7C.
For the sake of simplicity all coordinates are converted to degress with decimals after being read.

\subsubsection{Service virtualization}
The GPS only produces interesting data when it receives data from a number of satellites. 
This means that the GPS antenna needs to be outside, which is not very practical when developing software.
Therefore the output from the GPS with the antenna outside was piped into a file.
This file was then read by a program with a fixed time interval thus making a service virtualization of the GPS.
This service virtualization was used when developing software for the GPS.
