Motor data object: 4600h. includes motor slip frequency (not relevant), currents, voltages and temperature of heatsink. Don't know yet what the subindices are.
It is possible to map them to Process Data Object for fixed time updates. It doesn't say anywhere what update rate, we can achieve.
I've gotten a good amount of data from Karsten.
