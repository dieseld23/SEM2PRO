\section{System description}
\textbf{Communication of sensor data and parameters between a computer on our go-kart and a stationary computer.}\\
What is meant by "computer"\\
What kind of data?\\
What setup should be used for communication? Wireless/wired, what protocol etc.
What bandwidth/latency should the communication be able to handle?
Does the communication require extra verification? checksum, timestamping or 
similar.
Is storage necessary?
How is data produced? i.e. just by the sensors, by the go-kart or both systems?
How many sensors/data producers?\\
What kind of sensors/actuators?\\
Should we support asynchronous transfer? (different sensors with different 
update frequency transfer at different rates).\\
Which tasks should be handled where? i.e. can some tasks be handled locally on 
the go-kart?
