\section{System Description}
\label{sec:system_description}
This project aims to develop an embedded system for monitoring parameters on the SDU go-kart.

\mikkel{Maybe some more text here?}
\subsection{SDU go-kart}
The SDU go-kart is an electronic go-kart equipped with a PMAC motor. 
To control the motor there is a sevcon gen4 motor controller mounted on the go-kart, but other inverters could be mounted and used instead.
It has a pedal for controlling the torque produced by the motor and a conventional disc brake with the break pedal connected using hydraulics.
It has four SB12V20P-FC \footnote{Super B 'Super-B - SB12V20P-FC LiFepo4 battery.pdf - reference datasheet'.} batteries put in series, yielding a combined nominal voltage of 52.8V and a discharge current of 560A.
\thomas{The footnote references some .pdf? Where can I find this (rhetorical question)}
The PMAC motor installed on the go-kart is a three phase motor capable of producing 6hp continuously.
The go-kart can be seen in figure \ref{fig:go_kart}.

\end{figure}

\catalin{We cannot state that each year the students will do this.}
The SDU go-kart is used as a development platform for students at the Master of Electronics educations at SDU.
Each year first semester students need to develop a three phase inverter to drive the go-kart.

\catalin{The two sentences with "there needs" might need rephrasing.}
\subsection{Embedded System}
To ease development on the go-kart lecturers and students would like to be able to monitor parameters on the go-kart while driving.
To collect data on the go-kart there needs to be sensors and microcontrollers on the go-kart.
To monitor while driving there needs to be a wireless connection between the go-kart and a stationary computer, see figure \ref{fig:simple}.
Data should be presented to the user on a UI on the stationary computer.
All data should also be logged locally on the go-kart, as there might be wireless network failures. 
It should be possible to start or stop data collecting for specific sensors.

A basic use case diagram showing the desired functionality of the embedded system can be seen in figure \ref{fig:use_cases}.
The use case narratives are shown in tables \ref{tab:use_monitor} to \ref{tab:use_start_stop}.

%Relavant control variables should be controllable, while driving allowing for efficient testing of controllers.
%To achieve this, data should be collected on a computer on the go-kart and sent to a stationary computer.

%\subsection{What is the role of transferring go-kart data to and from a stationary computer?}
%To let an engineer or a mechanic monitor the status of the go-kart.

%Movement data could be usefull for testing new hardware, improving existing hardware and evaluation the drivers performance. 
%Data about battery status, currents, motortemperature is usefull for safety procedures.
%Data from the SEVCON xxx inverter or other inverters on the go-kart could be used for tuning parameters, evaluation performance and safety measures.
%On the basis of this data it should be possibly to change configuration parameters on the SEVCON xxx while driving the go-kart.

%\subsection{What is the role of the stationary computer?}
%The stationary computer should be responsible of the transmission of relevant go-kart data to and from the "on-board" computer.
%The received data should be presented to the user in a SCADA system.

%\subsubsection*{What data and sensors would be interesting to monitor?}
%Data from IMU, GPS and encoders would be necessary to monitor the movement of the go-kart.
%Data from the SEVCON xxx gives information about about battery status, currents, motortemperature.
%Temperature of tyres, speed of front wheels, possibility to control or at least moniter stearing and brake.
%It should be possible to get data from a new inverter, that is not yet made. 

%\subsubsection*{What kind is the stationary computer?}
%It should be possible for different personnel to monitor the go-kart data therefore the statinonary computer should just be general purpose computer running (linux?).

%\subsubsection*{What kind of communication is needed to transfer data between the go-kart computer and the stationary computer?}
%As it should be possibly to monitor data while the go-kart is driving the connection clearly needs to be wireless with a range allowing for driving on a typical racing track. 
%As all data is used by humans the propagation delay of the connection is not required to be very low.


%As live data should be easy to read? ("overskue" in danish) there needs to be a GUI or at least a UI that will present the user with easy readable data. SCADA SYSTEM!?!?!
%Changing of parameters on the go-kart should also be in the UI in order useable by others than the developers.

%\subsection{What is the role of the computer on the go-kart?}
%The "onboard" computer needs to handle the collection
%of data from different sensors (data producers).
%This computer will also handle the transmission of data to the stationary 
%computer.
%There are tasks that need to be handled locally fx strict safety measures (and future things fx localisation) that requires a miminum delay. 
%Storing of data with a 
%The computer needs also to store data locally in order to avoid data loss if the wireless connection is lost.

%\subsubsection*{How is local data transmission handled?}
%All data should be collected locally on the "on-board" computer to transmit it to the stationary computer.
%Local data collection should be "fast" and "reliable" for local safety measures to function properly.
%It should be possibly to collect data from and transmit data to at least the 
%aforementioned IMU, GPS and SEVCON xx with the possibility of adding additional 
%data producers.

%\subsubsection*{What kind is the "on-board" computer?}
%The computer should be a small embedded platform in order to mount it physcically on the go-kart.
%It should be able to handle all "on-board" tasks.

%Data should be stored directly on nonvolatile memory to be able retrieve data after shutdown.
%Data integrity checks is needed to ensure proper data logging.
%Correct data logging should be realised to ensure validity of data.
