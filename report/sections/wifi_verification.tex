\section{Wifi}
\label{sec:wifiverification}
A WiFi connection is required between the go-kart and a computer.
This connection is required to have a range of at least 80\si{\metre}.
Verifying that this is possible is done throughout this section.

\subsection{Method}
A Zybo with the TP-LINK TL-WN722N connected is placed with 80\si{\metre}, unobstructed, distance to a laptop.
The ad-hoc network is initiated using the method described in section \ref{sec:wifi}.
\texttt{ping} is used to verify that the connection is made.\\
A small program was written to verify a stable connection.
This program increments a counter every milliseconds and sends the value via WiFi PC to the Zybo.
Allowing this program to run for 10 seconds should yield 10000 data points on the receiving end.
This was repeated for 80\si{\metre} and 110\si{\metre}.
In both cases the complete dataset was received.
It was decided not to continue the test since the requirement was met at that point.
