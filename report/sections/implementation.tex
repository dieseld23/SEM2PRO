Throughout the analysis a number of decisions were made regarding the hardware and technologies to be used in the realisation of the system.
These are outlined in section \ref{sec:analysisconclusion}.
It was found that it is necessary to implement two different networks, one for collecting the data on the go-kart and one for transmitting the data to a monitoring station, assumed to be a standard PC throughout the remainder of the report.
These two networks will be referred to as the on-vehicle and off-vehicle networks, respectively.
The implementation of these, along with the remainder of the system, is described in this part.
Should a user or developer wish to implement their own node, a guide exists in appendix \ref{app:addnode}, outlining the steps necessary to implement a node.
