A node can be any kind of microcontroller, but this section will only address the case where a Zybo is used. 

The analysis part lead to a table of requirements and a design of the desired system.
This section will describe the implementation  in the process of realizing the design and meeting the requirements.
It was found that it is necessary to implement two different networks, one for collecting the data on the go-kart and one for transmitting the data to a monitoring station, assumed to be a standard PC throughout the remainder of the report.
These two networks will be referred to as the on-vehicle and off-vehicle networks, respectively.
The implementation o
