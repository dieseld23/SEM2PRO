\label{sec:system_analysis}
A thorough system analysis is needed in order to design a system that meets the needs expressed by the use cases. 
This section will present the analysis of the complete system, touching on the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{Parameters of interest:} In order to create a well-suited system it is necessary to gain knowledge of the type of parameters that may be of interest to monitor.
	\item \textbf{Hardware for monitoring parameters:} Having a list of parameters, what hardware is necessary to collect and monitor these parameters.
	\item \textbf{Data rate:} An investigation of the amount of data that can be expected from data producers connected to the system is required.
	\item \textbf{Data collection:} A number of sensors and other data producers is expected to exist on the go-kart.
	It is necessary to analyse how data from these is collected most effectively.
	\item \textbf{Embedded platform:} An investigation of what requirements the platform running the go-kart part of the system should satisfy.
	\item \textbf{Wireless network:} Data is required to be transmitted wirelessly from the go-kart to the monitoring station.
	An investigation of the appropriate technology will be conducted.
	\item \textbf{Local storage:} In order to log data, some form of local storage is required.
	This investigation will examine what options exist on the available platform to choose the appropriate solution.
	\item \textbf{Monitoring station interface:} An analysis of the appropriate interface on the stationary part of the system will be conducted.
