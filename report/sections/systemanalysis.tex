\label{sec:system_analysis}
A thorough system analysis is needed in order to design a system that meets the needs expressed by the use cases. 
This section will present the analysis of the complete system, touching on the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
	\item  \textbf{Parameters of interest:} In order to create a well-suited system it is necessary to gain knowledge of the type of parameters that may be of interest to monitor.
	\item \textbf{Hardware for monitoring parameters:} Having a list of parameters, what hardware is necessary to collect and monitor these parameters.
	\item \textbf{Data rate:} An investigation of the amount of data that can be expected from data producers connected to the system is required.
	\item \textbf{Data collection:} A number of sensors and other data producers is expected to exist on the go-kart.
	It is necessary to analyse how data from these is collected most effectively.
	\item \textbf{Embedded platform:} An investigation of what requirements the platform running the go-kart part of the system should satisfy.
	\item \textbf{Wireless network:} Data is required to be transmitted wirelessly from the go-kart to the monitoring station.
	An investigation of the appropriate technology will be conducted.
	\item \textbf{Local storage:} In order to log data, some form of local storage is required.
	This investigation will examine what options exist on the available platform to choose the appropriate solution.
	\item \textbf{Monitoring station interface:} An analysis of the appropriate interface on the stationary part of the system will be conducted.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:analysisconclusion}
\martin{Under construction.}
In the analysis, a number of decisions was taken in order to give a preliminary idea of how the system should be implemented. \\

A number of parameters of interest was explored, eventually boiling them down to three types of sensors: and IMU to measure relative motion, a GPS to measure the absolute position and the motor controller to measure speed of the wheel along with electrical parameters.

\begin{itemize}
	\item parameters of interest: Boiled down to IMU, GPS and motor controller
	\item hardware for monitoring: VN-100, U-blox NEO-6P Sevcon Gen4
	\item Data rate: losely calculated to 864 kb/s, but decided 1 Mb/s
	\item Data collection: CAN was decided to collect data from all sensors onto one node
	\item Embedded Platform: Zybo
	\item Wireless network: WiFi
	\item Local storage: Since the Zybos are running Linux, it is easy to collect and extract data from the SD card 
	\item monitoring station interface: A Linux bases computer will be used to receive data wirelessly from the go kart, and present it to a user.  
\end{itemize}

These decisions resulted in a list of requirements, which are listed in section~\ref{sec:system_requirements}.
