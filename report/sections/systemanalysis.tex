\section{System Analysis} % (fold)
\label{sec:system_analysis}
A thorough system analysis is needed in order to design an embedded system that meets the needs expressed by the use cases. 
This section will present the analysis of the complete embedded system, through the following topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Parameters of interest. The use cases do not describe what parameters should be monitored meaning that it should be investigated which are relevant to monitor.
\item Hardware for monitoring parameters. It should be analysed what hardware is necessary in order to measure the parameters found to be relevant. 
\item Data rate. It should be analysed what amount of data can be expected from the sensors connected to the system.
\item Data collection. It should be analysed how data is collected on the go-kart.
\item Micro-controller. It should be analysed what micro-controller should be used on the go-kart.
\item Wireless network. It should be analysed how data is transferred from the go-kart 	to the stationary computer.
\item Local storage. There needs to local storage on the go-kart and it needs to be analysed what kind this should be and how it should be implemented.
\item Software on stationary computer. It should be be analysed how the software on stationary should prensent the transferred data to the user in an UI.
\end{itemize}
