\martin{The can controllers do not have anything to do with xilinux. Does Xilinux provide drivers for the can controllers on the zynq? CAN controllers vs CAN drivers Issue - Some things rephrased.}

This section includes the process that was followed to enable the CAN controller in Linux.
The purpose of this was to gain access to the controllers from Linux.
Using this operating system was necessary for using the required USB interfaces, logging the data into files as well as utilizing the network tools to establish an ad-hoc network.
The steps for this were to modify certain files related to the kernel configurations and the device tree settings.

\subsubsection*{Enabling the CAN Controller Drivers}

According to Xilinx documentation, the process for enabling the CAN controllers on the Zynq7 Processing System, the Linux CAN driver guide \cite{Xilinx_wiki_Linux_CAN_driver} was needed to be followed.
Specifically, the Kconfig file under the path \ref{code:can_kconfig_pathfile} needed to be configured.
The entry at line 128 was changed as seen in code \ref{code:can_kconfig_contents_line128}.
Originally, lines 130 and 131 were as seen in code \ref{code:can_kconfig_original_line130}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={CAN Kconfig pathfile.},numbers=none,label=code:can_kconfig_pathfile]
/usr/src/kernels/3.12.0-xillinux-1.3/drivers/net/can
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=128,caption={Kconfig file contents from line 128.},label={code:can_kconfig_contents_line128}]
config CAN_XILINXCAN
	tristate "Xilinx(*@ @*)CAN"
	depends on NET [=y] && CAN_DEV [=y] && CAN [=y] && 
        (ARCH_ZYNQ || MICROBLAZE [=y])
	default y
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=130,caption={Original content of lines 130 and 131.},label={code:can_kconfig_original_line130}]
	depends on CAN && (ARCH_ZYNQ || MICROBLAZE)
	default n
\end{lstlisting}

The next step of the process was the modification of the device tree settings file, requiring an entry for the CAN PS to be inserted.
The necessary file was located under the boot folder named as seen in \ref{code:dts_file_zybo}.
The modifications can be seen in code \ref{code:dts_changes_zybo} for can controllers as well as for the AXI CAN core.

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none,caption={Device tree settings file and its path.},label={code:dts_file_zybo}]
/boot/xillinux-1.3-zybo.dts
\end{lstlisting}
\catalin{Double quotes are problem here as well. FIX THEM WHENEVER}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Device tree settings changes.},label={code:dts_changes_zybo}]
zynq_can_0: can@e0008000 {
        compatible = xlnx,zynq-can-1.0;
        clocks = <&clkc 19>, <&clkc 36>;
        clock-names = can_clk, pclk;
        reg = <0xe0008000 0x1000>;
        interrupts = <0 28 4>;
        interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
        tx-fifo-depth = <0x40>;
        rx-fifo-depth = <0x40>;
    };
axi_can_0: axi-can@40000000 {
        compatible = xlnx,axi-can-1.00.a;
        clocks = <&clkc 0>, <&clkc 1>;
        clock-names = can_clk,s_axi_aclk;
        reg = <0x40000000 0x10000>;
        interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
        interrupts = <0 59 1>;
        tx-fifo-depth = <0x40>;
        rx-fifo-depth = <0x40>;
        };
\end{lstlisting}

Unfortunately, the above steps did not enable the drivers successfully.
After the changes, the CAN devices were still not visible in Linux and thus, connection to the CAN network was not feasible.
Research was done by the authors in why this could not be accomplished.
It was found that there were some naming inconsistencies between the guide and the Device Tree Settings file present in Linux running on the Zybo. Specifically, all the devices' names in the file are prepended with ps7.
A new set of changes with this naming convention was done, but with no success.\\

The files mentioned above were modified in the Linux running on the Zybo.
It was expected the changes to take effect after rebooting the system, which was not the case.
Another approach to this, was to build a new kernel containing these changes and to entirely build a new Linux system for the Zybo.
This proved to be unachievable because of the various patches that had been applied to the initial kernel by Diligent Inc. and Xilinx.
A new updated kernel with those patches could not be built MIKKEL.
\mikkel{say a few words why could not be built, just the main reason, after ...could not be built ....}
