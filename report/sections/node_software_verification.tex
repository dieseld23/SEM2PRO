\section{Node Software}
\label{sec:node_software}
When addressing the node software it is important to remember the distinction between sensor node software and wifi node software.
The software for the wifi node has not been implemented therefore this section will only address the verification of the functionalities of the sensor node software implemented on a GPS sensor node.

\subsection{GPS Sensor Node}
The functionality of the developed GPS sensor node software was tested as shown in figure \ref{fig:sensor_gps_veri}.
The GPS service virtualization was run to input data as a GPS module does. 
The GPS node software then processed the data and output it to standard output as the CAN bus connection was not realized.

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{Testing the node software. The node software receives data from a list of GPS data and inputs from \texttt{std::cin}. It outputs to \texttt{std::cout}.}
	\label{fig:sensor_gps_veri}
\end{figure}

When running the software is run it outputs only a string of booleans. 
This is not very readable by humans, so to show the functionality the program was set to print in a humanly understandable way.
A segment of the output from this can be seen in code \ref{code:output_node}.
The first frame should be a timestamp frame.
It can be seen that the the first frame has node ID 14, 4 data bytes, messagetype 1 and data 2374, meaning that it is from the GPS node with a timestamp of 2374 milliseconds.
The next frame should then be a data frame containing latitude and longitude information.
It can be seen that it has node ID 14, 8 data bytes and messagetype 9, which is a latitude longitude message.
To extract the latitude and longitude from the data field an unpacking algorithm is needed.
Using that it is found that latitude is 55.3673346 degrees North and longitude is 10.4318456 degrees East.

It should be possible to send a sync command to the node by giving it the message ID \texttt{10001111000}.
When typing this into the shell it can be seen that the nodes timestamp is reset.
By sending the message ID \texttt{10001111010} the node stops outputting data.
The node starts sending data again if the message ID \texttt{10001111001} is sent.\\

The link to the CAN program is not made and therefore the tests are made with standard I/O.
By using service virtualization it is verified that the GPS sensor node software has implemented the wanted functionalities.
