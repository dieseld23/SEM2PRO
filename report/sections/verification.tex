The complete system was not made to function, however, most of the subsystems were.
Throughout this section tests will be designed and carried out in order to verify that the various subsystems live up to the requirements set in section \ref{sec:system_requirements}.
\\~\\
Service virtualisation is used extensively in verifying the various systems.
This is the process of emulating one piece of hardware such that another can act on the input given it.
\\~\\
Four parts are tested throughout this section, the CAN network, the WiFi, the node software and the front end.
These parts constitute both the system on the go-kart as well as the system on the monitoring station.
