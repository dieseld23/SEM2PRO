This project would not have been possible with the invaluable assistance and patience of our supervisor. 
A Tremendous thank you to Leon Bonde Larsen.
The process was simplified greatly by Assistant Professor Kjeld Jensen from which the sensory equipment used in the report was supplied.

\section*{Abstract}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Abstract}
A go-kart has been supplied as a development platform for student projects at University of Southern Denmark.
In the interest of enabling more complex projects, a unified data collection system is necessary.
This is developed throughout this report. 
An analysis is done to determine the requirements of such a system.
It was found that a two-part network is suitable for this application.
The two parts are a CAN network and an ad-hoc WiFi network.
A custom protocol for use on can, GoCAN, is developed.
GoCAN supports up to 16 sensors from which data can be monitored on a remote monitoring station using the WiFi connection.
The system was only partially implemented since the authors did not achieve a connection between the CAN network and Linux.
